Here is an explanation of each argument and its impact in the context of training a reinforcement learning agent using Deep Q-Networks (DQN):

### 1. **`--seed`**
   - **Type:** Integer
   - **Default:** `1626`
   - **Min:** Any integer (typically ≥ 0)
   - **Max:** Any integer (no theoretical max, but often kept within 32-bit integer range for reproducibility)
   - **Meaning:** Sets a random seed; doesn’t impact learning directly but affects reproducibility.
   - **Meaning:** Sets a random seed for reproducibility, ensuring the same random values are used each run. This allows experiments to be comparable by initializing the random number generator in a consistent way.

### 2. **`--eps-test`**
   - **Type:** Float
   - **Default:** `0.05`
   - **Min:** `0.0` (full exploitation, no exploration)
   - **Max:** `1.0` (full exploration, no exploitation)
   - **Effect:** Higher values lead to more exploration in testing, but 0.05–0.1 is common to evaluate learned policies without too much randomness.
   - **Meaning:** Sets the epsilon (ε) exploration rate during testing, controlling the agent's tendency to explore vs. exploit in evaluation.
     - **Small Values (e.g., 0.05):** The agent mostly exploits its learned policy during testing.
     - **Large Values:** More random actions are taken, which could reduce consistency in evaluating the learned policy.

### 3. **`--eps-train`**
   - **Type:** Float
   - **Default:** `0.1`
   - **Min:** `0.0` (exploitation only)
   - **Max:** `1.0` (exploration only)
   - **Effect:** Lower values encourage exploitation, higher values encourage exploration. A common range for ε decay during training is 1.0 (start) to 0.1–0.01 (end).
   - **Meaning:** Sets epsilon (ε) during training, allowing the agent to explore more than during testing.
     - **Small Values:** The agent mainly exploits, potentially limiting discovery of better strategies.
